# Approximation of Eulerâ€™s Number Using Geometry and Probability

## Overview

This project explores a novel approach to approximating Euler's Number (e) through fundamental concepts in Geometry and Probability, making it accessible to high school students. Unlike traditional methods that require advanced mathematical knowledge, our approach simplifies the process using basic mathematical principles.

## Abstract

Euler's Number (e) is a significant irrational number with numerous applications across various fields. Existing algorithms for approximating e often demand advanced mathematical skills, making them less suitable for high school students. This project introduces a new algorithm for approximating e that leverages high school-level Geometry and Probability. 

The methodology is divided into two main components:

1. **Theoretical Part:** We derive the equation:

   `1 / N_u = m * (1 / N_s - 1 / N_e)`

   where `m = 1`, and `x` represents the value of e. This part focuses on determining areas on a graph to establish a relationship for approximation.

2. **Experimental Part:** We use random points on the graph to compute areas. Linear Regression is applied to fit a linear equation by adjusting parameters. The experimental results show that with a starting number of points of at least 1,500, and incrementing the number of points by 1,000, a total of 10 points for approximation yields an average Euler's number in the range of 2.5 - 2.7, with a deviation of about 7% from the true value.
